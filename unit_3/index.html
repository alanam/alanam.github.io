	<h3 class="title">Brand Story</h3>
		<p class="description">At HallPass, we are passionate about helping people reach their career goals. We want to make this process as simple and straightforward as possible. Our brand is clean and sharp, with the goal of facilitating the use of our service. </p>
	<h3 class="title">The HallPass Experience</h3>
		<p class="description">Everyone should have the opportunity to pursue their dreams. However, higher education can often times be an unreachable goal, especially for people who cannot afford to go to college. We believe that there is an alternative to the traditional four year degree. We strive to connect students to companies they want to work for, and give them the opportunity to take courses at a piece-meal basis, with the goal of gaining the neccessary skills for the positions they are interested in pursuing. This model will allow someone who otherwise not pursue higher education, to gain the necessary skills to land great jobs. We believe this is the higher education of the future. </p>
	<h3 class="title">Brand Identity</h3>
		<p class="description">A brand is more than words and a logo. It is a philosophical approach to how a company expresses itself and the story it tells. Brands who understand themselves completely have better overall communication. That is why we don not try to be all things to everyone. Rather, we focus on being ourselves, true to our core purpose and what makes us unique in the world. A consistent voice and tone, combined with visuals that express our brand story, help us to express this through a cohesive, recognizable brand personality.</p>
	<h3 class="title">Brand Pillars</h3>
		<p class="description">The following brand pillars help create a cohesive identity and brand foundation that represents who we are and how we behave in the world in an authentic and engaging way.</p>
			<p class="list">Clean and clear</p>
			<p class="list">Sleak and staightforward</p>
			<p class="list">Simple and seamless</p>
