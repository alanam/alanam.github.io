						<h4 class="title2">The HallPass Experience</h4>
							<p class="description">Everyone should have the opportunity to pursue their dreams. We strive to connect students to companies they want to work for, and give them the opportunity to take courses at a piece-meal basis, with the goal of gaining the neccessary skills for the positions they are interested in pursuing. This is the higher education of the future. </p>

					<h4 class="title2">Brand Story</h4>
						<p class="description">At HallPass, we are passionate about helping people reach their 	career goals. We want to make this process as simple and straightforward as possible. Our brand is clean and sharp, with the purpose of facilitating the use of our service. </p>

				<!-- Voice and Tone. This part will explain the difference between each and delineate the specifics for both categories -->
					<h3 class="title">Voice and Tone</h3>
						<h4 class="title2">Voice</h4>
							<p class="description">The HallPass voice is that of a wise guru guiding you through those tough decisions. It's professional, it's stern, but also inviting. We want you to feel like you are talking to a really knowledgeable and hip mentor.</p>
						<h4 class="title2">Tone</h4>
							<p class="description">The tone for our brand is a little different from the voice. It understands what you are going through. It sympathizes with your uncertainity for the future, with your fear of what is to come. It makes you feel warm fuzzy feelings but it also makes you want to keep moving forward. Our tone makes you want to talk about your hopes and dreams over coffee.</p>
