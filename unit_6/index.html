				<h2>Our Story</h2>
				<p>Everyone should have the opportunity to pursue their dreams. We strive to connect students to companies they want to work for, and give them the access to take courses at a piece-meal basis, with the goal of gaining the neccessary skills for the positions they are interested in pursuing. This is the higher education of the future. </p>

			<h1>Voice and Tone</h1>
			<section id="voice" class="feel">
				<h2>Voice</h2>
				<p>The HallPass voice is that of a wise guru guiding you through those tough decisions. It's professional, it's stern, but also inviting. We want you to feel like you are talking to a really knowledgeable and hip mentor.</p>

			<section id="tone" class="feel">
				<h2>Tone</h2>
				<p>The tone for our brand is a little different from the voice. It understands what you are going through. It sympathizes with your uncertainity for the future, with your fear of what is to come. Our tone makes you want to talk about your hopes and dreams over coffee.</p>
